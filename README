This is a simple test application for controlling Spectrum-branded wallboard/LED sign displays via a serial port.

It is quite basic, and doesn't use all of the wallboard's capabilities. It supports showing a single message (via the "priority file").

The following features are implemented:
	* Set message vertical position
	* Set message colour
	* Set message style
	* Set message 'special' style (eg. animations)
